# LAMMPS

[LAMMPS] is a classical molecular dynamics code with a focus on materials modeling. It's an acronym for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator. LAMMPS has potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and soft matter (biomolecules, polymers) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. It can be used to model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or continuum scale. See [LAMMPS Features] for a detailed overview.

## Running

```bash
uenv start <LAMMPS_UENV>
uenv view lammps
```

!!! warning
    [LAMMPS] is built with GPU-aware MPI. Make sure to set `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1` when running [LAMMPS].

## Building from source

The [LAMMPS] `uenv` provides all the dependencies required to build [LAMMPS] from source, including kokkos. You can follow these steps to build [LAMMPS] from source:

```bash
# Start uenv and load develop view
uenv start <LAMMPS_UENV>
uenv view develop

# cd to LAMMPS source directory
cd <PATH_TO_LAMMPS_SOURCE>

# CMake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -C ../cmake/presets/kokkos-cuda.cmake ../cmake/  -DKokkos_ENABLE_IMPL_CUDA_MALLOC_ASYNC=OFF -DKokkos_ARCH_NATIVE=yes -DKokkos_ARCH_HOPPER90=yes

cmake --build . --parallel 32
```
