# NAMD

[NAMD] is a parallel molecular dynamics code based on [Charm++] designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems.

!!! danger "Licensing Terms and Conditions"
    
    [NAMD] is distributed free of charge for research purposes only and not for commercial use: users must agree to [NAMD license] in order to use it at [CSCS]. Users agree to acknowledge use of [NAMD] in any reports or publications of results obtained with the Software (see [NAMD Homepage] for details).

!!! warning

    Currently, we only provide single-GPU and single-node multi-GPU [NAMD] builds, which greatly benefit from the new GPU-resident mode providing very fast dynamics (see [NAME 3.0 new features]). If you require a multi-node version of [NAMD], please contact us.

## Single-node build

The single-node build works on a single node and benefits from the new GPU-resident mode (see [NAMD 3.0b6 GPU-Resident benchmarking results] for more details).

### Building from source

The [NAMD] `uenv` provides all the dependencies required to build [NAMD] from source. You can follow these steps to build [NAMD] from source:

```bash
# Start uenv and load develop view
uenv start namd.squashfs
uenv view develop

# cd to NAMD source directory
cd <PATH_TO_NAMD_SOURCE>

# Build bundled Charm++
tar -xvf charm-7.0.0.tar && cd charm-v7.0.0
./build charm++ multicore-linux-arm8 gcc --with-production --enable-tracing -j 32

# Build NAMD
cd ..
./config Linux-ARM64-g++.cuda \
    --charm-arch multicore-linux-arm8-gcc --charm-base $PWD/charm-v7.0.0 \
    --with-tcl --tcl-prefix /user-environment/env/develop \
    --with-fftw --with-fftw3 --fftw-prefix /user-environment/env/develop \
    --cuda-gencode arch=compute_90,code=sm_90 --with-single-node-cuda --with-cuda --cuda-prefix /user-environment/env/develop
cd Linux-ARM64-g++.cuda && make -j 32

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/user-environment/env/develop/lib/

# Run NAMD
./namd3 <NAMD_OPTIONS>
```
